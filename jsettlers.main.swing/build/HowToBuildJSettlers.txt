To build JSettlers.jar and get an independent folder that can run the game do the follwowing:

1. Build JSettlers.jar by executing the JSettlersBuild.fatjar via the context menu (NOTE: FatJar Eclipse Plugin must be installed)
2. Copy config.prp and JSettlers.jar from the build folder to a new empty folder.
3. Copy the complete resources folder from the jsettlers.common project to the target folder.
4. Copy the complete libs folder from the go.graphics.swing project to the target folder.
5. Configure the config.prp file to lead to the paths of the GFX and SND folders of the original The Settlers III game.


Have fun.
